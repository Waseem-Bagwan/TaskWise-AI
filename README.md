Taskwise-AI

🚀 Taskwise-AI is an AI-powered platform that selects the most suitable model based on the user’s prompt and generates responses for them.
Currently, I’m still working on the frontend development. The backend is already set up with features like authentication, request control, and payments.

✨ Features (Backend Done ✅)
  🔑 JWT Authentication – secure login & user sessions
  ⏳ Rate Limiter – control how many requests a user can make in a given time
  💳 Razorpay Integration – users can buy credits to make more requests
  🤖 Model Selection – backend decides the right AI model based on user input

🚧 Current Status
  ✅ Backend development completed
  🛠 Frontend development in progress
  📌 Next step: Connect frontend UI with backend APIs
  
🛠 Tech Stack
  Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS (in progress)
  Backend: Node.js, Express
  Database: MongoDB
  Other: JWT, Rate Limiter, Razorpay
